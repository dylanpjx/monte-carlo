# monte-carlo

Monte carlo approximation of pi:
- Draw a square and inscribe a quadrant within it
- Uniformly scatter a number of points onto the square
- Find the ratio, `number of points in the quadrant` : `total number of points`
- The ratio is an estimate of `area of quadrant` : `area of square`
- Therefore, ratio * 4  = pi
r = 1 for this use case.
